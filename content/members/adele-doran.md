## Track Record

My research focuses on the experiences of adventure tourists and adventure recreationalists.

Primary research has focused on the experiences of female climbers and mountaineers, the constraints they encounter and negotiate when accessing and participating in the sport and the benefits they gain from these experiences. Additional projects include an investigation of women’s representation on adventure social media and the impact adventure activities have on women’s well-being.

I employ a range of methodologies to study the experiences of adventure participants, including survey research, ethnography and social media research.

I am a member of the Adventure Tourism Research Association (ATRA), an organisation which seeks to bring together academics, adventure professionals and commercial operators, and I am a steering group committee member. 

As a member of ORRG, I am currently  working with Sheffield City Council on a project to develop adventure-based city breaks designed to attract international sports enthusiasts. The project was awarded by VisitBritain and their Discover England fund.
