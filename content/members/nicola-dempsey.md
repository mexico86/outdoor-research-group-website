My research interests relate to understanding the complex relationship between landscape and humans. They focus on sustainable landscape planning and management, in particular how urban and rural landscape planning and management affect everyday life, quality of life and wellbeing. I am also interested in different research theories and methods employed to understand the landscape and the associated perceptions held by residents and users in different contexts.
